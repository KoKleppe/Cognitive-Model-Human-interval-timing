# Data-analysis/model Human-interval timing

# Project Title

This script shows an analysis and a model of an experiment whereby participants were instructed to reproduce short intervals coming from either a short or long condition (~300 ms - 1100ms). The model relies on Bayesian inference whereby intervals are each associated with a likelihood of retrieval. A linear regression was used to determine what parameters (previously encountered duration, current condition, length duration relative to the condition, etc) had the greatest influence on the reproduced interval.
