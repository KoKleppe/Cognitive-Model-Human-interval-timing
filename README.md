# Data-analysis/model Human-interval timing

# Project Title

This scripts shows an analysis and a model of an experiment whereby participants were instructed to reproduce short intervals coming from either a short or long condition. The model relies on Bayesian inference whereby a range of intervals are each associated with a probability of retrieval. A linear regression was used to determine what parameters (previous encountered duration, current condition, duration relative to the condition, etc) had the greatest influenced on the reproduced interval.
